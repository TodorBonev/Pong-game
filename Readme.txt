Welcome to my pong game project! You can play the game with the arrow keys on your keyboard.


Features
Play pong game against computer, using arrow keys on your keyboard (up and down). At the begining you can select difficulty level (by default is set to "amateur"), and click "Start game".
Score. The score starts from 0-0 , and after some of the players misses the shot, his opponent wins a point. The first to score 10 points wins the game.
Levels of difficulty. At the begining you can select difficulty level (levels are from "amateur" to "master"). The selected level determines how precisely the computer follows the ball.
Ball speed increase. When the rally gets longer, the ball's speed gradually increases, making following the ball more difficult.
"Stop game" After clicking "Start game" button, it disappears and the "Stop game" button appears in the same place. After clicking it, the game stops, and the "Start game" button reapears again.
